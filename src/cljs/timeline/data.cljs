If you have faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, we invite you to join us in communion.  It does not matter what your church affiliation is.  You are welcome even if you have no affiliation at all. Children are welcome to participate in communion at their parents’ discretion. If a parent would like more information or help explaining the Lord’s Supper, please ask one of the pastors."}]}

                         :content "Fourteen-year-old African-American Emmett Till is brutally murdered after reportedly flirting with a white woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi. For the first time, both black and white reporters cover the trial epitomizing.  The white defendants, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, are acquitted by an all-white jury in only 67 minutes; later they describe in full detail to Look magazine (which paid them $4,000) how they killed Till. His mother insists on an open casket funeral, and the powerful image of his mutilated body sparks a strong reaction across the country and the world."}]}

Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964, mandating equal opportunity employment, and complete desegregation of schools and other public facilities. It also outlaws unequal voter registration requirements. Although it would take years for these changes to take effect in communities around the country, the law is a monumental victory for the civil rights movement. "}
